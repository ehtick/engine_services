  ## Sidebar navigation
  ---
  Product teams building BIM apps often need multiple distinct views — a 3D model
  viewer, a data browser, a settings screen — but wiring a custom nav bar and
  managing view transitions from scratch adds complexity before any real feature
  work begins.

  top-app supports named layouts with a built-in sidebar navigation bar that
  switches the active grid template on click, so teams get multi-view navigation
  without building the scaffolding themselves.

  This tutorial covers defining three named layouts with their own grid templates
  and icons; providing a dedicated element for each view; enabling the sidebar nav
  bar; and setting the initial active layout.

  By the end, you'll have a multi-view BIM app with a persistent sidebar that lets
  users switch between a 3D viewer, a data panel, and a settings screen.
