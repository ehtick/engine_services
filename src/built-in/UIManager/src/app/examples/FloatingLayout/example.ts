  ## Floating layout
  ---
  Developers building BIM coordination tools often want the 3D model to fill the
  entire window while control panels float above it — but standard grid layouts
  give every area equal standing, shrinking the viewer into one cell and leaving
  visible seams between it and the panels.

  top-app supports a floating mode where one element is mounted as an absolute
  background that fills the container edge-to-edge, and all other layout areas
  render as a transparent overlay on top of it with independent pointer events.

  This tutorial covers assigning the viewer as the absolute background of the app;
  defining an overlay layout where a side panel floats above the viewer without
  sharing grid space; and annotating why the base element is excluded from the
  layout template.

  By the end, you'll have a full-screen 3D viewer with a floating side panel
  hovering above it, with the model filling the entire window and the panel
  receiving its own pointer events.
