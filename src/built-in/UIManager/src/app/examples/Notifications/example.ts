  ## Toasts, file drop, and cross-component notifications
  ---
  Developers building BIM processing UIs need to surface status updates, errors,
  and file-drop feedback to users from different points in the component tree —
  but reaching back to the app root to trigger a notification from a deeply nested
  component requires threading a reference through every layer in between.

  top-app provides a built-in toast system that any descendant can trigger by
  dispatching a standard DOM event, a drag-and-drop overlay that activates
  automatically when files enter the window, and a drop-zone message that can be
  computed from live state at render time rather than set once at initialization.

  This tutorial covers showing a success toast when the app finishes booting;
  building a component that dispatches notification events to report async progress
  and completion without a reference to the root; handling dropped files, filtering
  them by extension, and showing a warning when none are supported; and setting the
  drop-zone message as a function that reads a live model counter.

  By the end, you'll have an app with a full notification layer — a boot
  confirmation toast, async status reporting from a child component, and a
  drag-and-drop zone whose message updates as models are loaded.
