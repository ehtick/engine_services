  ## Shared reactive state with AppState
  ---
  Developers building interactive BIM panels often need sibling components — a
  filter selector and a results table, for example — to stay in sync without a
  shared parent. Lifting state to a common ancestor and threading it down as props
  works for shallow trees but becomes unwieldy as the component tree grows.

  top-app provides a typed reactive state object available to every component in
  the tree through context. Any component can write to it, and all subscribers
  re-render automatically — no shared parent required.

  This tutorial covers defining a typed payload for custom app state; building a
  filter selector that updates shared state on button click; building a results
  counter that reads the current filter and count from shared state; composing both
  into a panel inside a top-app layout; and noting when the shared state is
  available relative to the engine boot sequence.

  By the end, you'll have two independent components that stay in sync through
  shared reactive state — a filter selector and a results counter that reflect each
  other's changes without any direct coupling between them.
