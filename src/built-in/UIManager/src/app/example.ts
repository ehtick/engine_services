  ## top-app
  ---
  Front-end developers building BIM web apps need to coordinate several async
  initialization steps before the UI can be shown — loading the engine, preparing
  fragment workers, registering loaders — and users need visible feedback on what
  is happening during that wait, rather than a blank screen.

  top-app is the platform's root shell element. It manages the full boot sequence,
  tracks each async setup task individually, shows a labelled loading screen until
  every task completes, and then mounts the app's visual layout.

  This tutorial covers initializing the platform client and registering all
  platform web components; registering two async setup tasks — the fragment worker
  and the IFC loader — each with its own loading-screen label; declaring a named
  layout area as a CSS grid template; wiring a 3D viewer into that layout; and
  using a flag to keep the loading screen visible during development.

  By the end, you'll have a working app shell that boots the engine, shows a
  step-by-step loading screen, and mounts a 3D viewer once every setup task
  resolves.
